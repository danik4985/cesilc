# CesilC

> CESIL, or Computer Education in Schools Instruction Language, is a programming language designed to introduce pupils in British secondary schools to elementary computer programming. It is a simple language containing a total of fourteen instructions. 

[![license: GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](COPYING) [![version: 1.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.0-green.svg)](README.md) [![build: linux and shitdows only](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-linux%20and%20shitdows%20only-yellow.svg)](README.md) [![amogus: sus](https://img.shields.io/badge/amogus-sus-black.svg)](README.md)

Ladies and gentlemen, [CESIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CESIL) time. That's right, I did it again! And this time it works (maybe).

47 years later, introducing a brand new, fast, epic cesil compiler.

## Installation
> There is currently no binary build for macos. That is because linux -> mac cross-compilation fails with some long and chaotic error message and It would be super complicated to fix and I don't want to have to read the Xcode license and I'm sure it would make me give all my copyright rights to Apple \[...]

There are installation scripts in the releases.

## Syntax
I was not able to find any official specifictions, so I had to go mainly by the wikipedia article. When it was first created, cesil was punched onto punch cards. This means that the syntax written in a text file on a computer must be modified a little. Here is what I did:
- You are not forced to use columns
- If a line starts with `(`, it is a comment
- Empty lines and comments are ingored
- If a line starts with an identifier, then the first word is considered a label, word 2 is condidered the command and word 3 (if it exists) is considered the argument
- If the line starts with a whitespace, the first word is considered the command and the second one the argument

This means that the following program:
```
        LOAD    +0
LOOP    STORE   TOTAL
        UIN
        JINEG   DONE
        ADD     TOTAL
        JUMP    LOOP

DONE    PRINT   "The total is: "
        LOAD    TOTAL
        OUT
        LINE
        HALT
```

is just as valid as
```
 LOAD +0
LOOP STORE TOTAL
 UIN
 JINEG DONE
 ADD TOTAL
 JUMP LOOP

DONE PRINT "The total is: "
 LOAD TOTAL
 OUT
 LINE
 HALT

```

Data section starts with `%` and ends with `*`

## Compilation targets

The compiler will detect the target you want from the output file extension.

### Current
- [x] C (.c)
- [x] native binaries (No extension [linux]/.app [MacOS]/.exe [Shitdows])
- [x] Bash (.sh)
- [x] JavaScript (.js)

### Planned
- [ ] Java
- [ ] APKs (using java)
- [ ] Batch files (MS-DOS compatible)
- [ ] PHP

#### Compilation to JS
1. Currently only works in browser
2. You include the build script in the browser using `<script src="your-script.js">` and then use `window.CESIL_RUN(...)`
3. If you give the `CESIL_RUN` function a function as an argument (eg `window.CESIL_RUN(x => console.log(">" + x))`), that function will be used for logging. If you give it a query selector (eg `window.CESIL_RUN('#output')`), it will put output into the selected element.
4. You can define `window.CESIL_LINE_END` to set a custom line break string.
5. Feel free to use the code from test.html

Dm me on discord if you want to request a compilation target!

## API coverage
- This implementation covers 100% of cesil api.
- A new instruction is added: `UIN`, this reads a number from stdin and saves it to the accumulator. This is for interactivness of your binaries and won't compile unless you use the *interactive* flag.

## CLI usage

Run `cesilc --help` to get cli usage information.

## Preprocessor

CesilC has its own preprocessor! It currently only has one command: `#include filename`

#### Careful!

Do **not** enclose the file name in `"`

```
( Correct
#include source.ces

( Wrong
#include "source.ces"
```

## Roadmap
- [ ] Catch some errors at compilation time
- [ ] Error handeling so the compiler doesnt ever crash
- [ ] More compilation targets
- [ ] ...

## Additional questions
If you have any questions or want to contact me for any reason, add me on discord: `danik#4985`

## Development
You can make your own compilation targets, just have a look at the source.
You can use `make_release.sh` to generate binaries for all platforms.

## License
This program uses the GPLv3 license. See its full text in the [COPYING](COPYING) file!

## Notes
- Compilation to mac and shitdows binaries isn't tested. In case it doesnt work, compile to c source and use your compiler to compile that. (And report it to issues).
- To compile to binaries, you need to have `gcc` installed.
- If you encounter any problems, please report them in the *issues* tab.
- If you enjoy this project, I would be very happy if you starred it (so that more people see it.) ‚≠ê
